The BeagleBone LCD3 cape provides a portable LCD solution with touchscreen capability for BeagleBone boards. The 3.5" TFT LCD screen, stacked on the topside of the board, can display up to 320x240 resolution and is a 4-wire resistive touchscreen. Seven buttons on the board are located at finger-friendly positions. In addition to power and reset, the BeagleBone LCD3 is also equipped with five user buttons which can be controlled by GPIO signals. The backside of the cape is where the BeagleBone can be mounted thanks to a set of three long-tail expansion connectors.
